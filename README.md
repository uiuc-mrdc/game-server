# django-2020

The Django server for the 2020 MRDC Game Server.

## Requirements

* You should have at least Python 3.5 (*definitely* some version of Python 3).
  * Along with this, you'll need pip3.
  * Both can be installed with `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip`.
* Obviously, you'll need Django (`pip3 install Django`).

## Running the server

* Use `python3 manage.py runserver` to start the Django server.
